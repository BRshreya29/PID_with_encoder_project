# PID_with_encoder_project
I have successfully implemented two Arduino codes that demonstrate my understanding of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control concept. These codes control a motor's speed and position using encoder feedback and apply PID control to achieve accurate positioning. The first code employs interrupts and atomic operations for stability, while the second code uses interrupt-driven encoder readings.
This code has been implemented in Arduino IDE software.
